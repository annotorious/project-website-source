# Headless Mode: Using Annotorious without the Editor Popup

Want to use Annotorious only for the drawing tools? But don't need 
the editor? That's what __headless mode__ is for! In headless mode, you keep 
all the standard functionality: drawing and editing shapes, JavaScript API, 
lifecycle events. But you are free to build your own user interface, without being 
forced to the standard editor popup.  

The demo uses headless mode to create annotations with either an __Orange__
or __Green__ tag, and a [formatter](/annotorious/api-docs/annotorious/#formatters)
to color the shapes. (To delete an annotation, select it and press the __Delete__ key.)

## The Headless API

To use Annotorious without the editor popup, the following API options are 
important:

- `disableEditor`, a config option and instance field to switch headless mode
  on and off
- the `createSelection` event, which fires when the user has created a new selection
- the `selectAnnotation` event, which fires when the user selects an existing annotation
- `updateSelected`, an API method for modifying annotation bodies programmatically
- `saveSelected`, an API method that provides a programmatic way to save an (updated)
  annotation

### disableEditor

The `disableEditor` option defines whether Annotorious will show the editor (normal mode)
or not (headless mode). You can disable the editor when you initialize Annotorious:

```js
var anno = Annotorious.init({
  image: 'hallstatt',
  disableEditor: true
});
```

Or you can change the value of the `disableEditor` instance field at any time.

```js
anno.disableEditor = true; // Annotorious is now in headless mode
anno.disableEditor = false; // back to normal mode
```

### createSelection and selectAnnotation

In normal mode, the editor opens when the user creates a new selection, or selects
an existing annotation. In headless mode, you want your code to handle these events.

You can do this by attaching handler functions for the `createSelection` and `selectAnnotation` 
events.

```js
anno.on('createSelection', function(selection) {
  // The user has created a new shape...
});

anno.on('selectAnnotation', function(annotation) {
  // The users has selected an existing annotation
});
```

### updateSelected and saveSelected

In your handler functions, you will typically perform modifications on the
selected annotation. The `updateSelected` method allows you to replace the 
current selection with a modified one.

After you have called `updateSelected`, the annotation is still in draft state.
To make the change persistent, you need to save it by calling `saveSelected`.
This will persist the change (and Annotorious will fire `createAnnotation` or 
`updateAnnotation` events accordingly).

> __Important:__ `updateSelected` is an asynchronous operation. It takes a while
> to complete and returns a `Promise`. Make sure you wait until `updateSelected`
> completes before calling `saveSelected`!

```js
// This does not work
anno.updateSelected(modified);
anno.saveSelected();

// This works
await anno.updateSelected(selection);
anno.saveSelected();

// And this works, too
anno.updateSelected(selection).then(function() {
  anno.saveSelected();
});
```

Because some applications will often apply only a single change, and then save immediately,
`updateSelected` also includes a convenience "update and save" option.

```js
// This updates and saves immediately, no
// more need to call .saveSelected
anno.updateSelected(modified, true);
```

## Code Example

The code below shows a full working example: when the user 
creates a new shape, the application inserts a tag automatically, and 
saves the annotation.  (The tag is hard-wired in the example. But you could 
easily make it a variable that's changed via a text input or dropdown in 
your page.) 

1. activates headless mode on init
2. attaches a `createSelection` listener, which inserts a (hard-coded) tag into new selections
3. saves the annotation

```js
var anno = Annotorious.init({
  image: 'hallstatt',
  locale: 'auto',

  // Step 1: activate headless mode by 
  // disabling the editor
  disableEditor: true
});

// Step 2: add a listener that modifies selections
// created by the user
anno.on('createSelection', async function(selection) {

  // Tag to insert
  selection.body = [{
    type: 'TextualBody',
    purpose: 'tagging',
    value: 'MyTag'
  }];

  // Step 3: update the selection and save it
  // Remember that .updateSelected is an async function!
  // You need to wait until it completes before saving
  await anno.updateSelected(selection);
  anno.saveSelected();

  // Alternative:
  // anno.updateSelected(selection, true);
});
```
